At Devito Codes, we continue to push the boundaries of seismic imaging and wave
propagation. Our latest innovation, to be showcased at IMAGE'24, addresses one
of the most challenging aspects of land seismic imaging: accurately modeling
wavefields in the presence of complex topography using finite-difference
methods, all without the need for unstructured mesh generation.

## Imaging from Topography

High-quality topography handling enables calculation of accurate gradients and FWI topographic updates, even in settings where topographic variation is extreme. If forward and adjoint modeling can capture the physics of the free-surface, these effects become data rather than noise; leveraging this data enhances resolution and illumination, whilst minimizing the requisite preprocessing and streamlining imaging workflows. However, failure to accurately account for the effects of topographic variation leads to images which are unfocused and artefact-prone at best, and entirely incoherent at worst. It follows that for confident and robust land seismic imaging, accurate topography implementation is crucial.

## Understanding the Challenge

Traditionally, incorporating topography into solvers has been a complex and
time-consuming task, often requiring the development of bespoke solutions that
are difficult to generalize across different wave equations. While
finite-element methods and mesh generation offer potential solutions, they come
with significant challenges, including a lack of software and practical
experience in developing finite-element inversion methods for exploration
geophysics and the absence of robust automatic mesh generation techniques. These
factors make finite-element approaches less attractive for building efficient
seismic imaging processing pipelines, further complicating the incorporation of
complex topography for land seismic imaging.

## A General Approach to Modelling Complex Topography

To solve this problem, we’ve developed Schism, a module that automatically
generates immersed-boundary operators for Devito. Schism simplifies the
integration of complex topographies into wave propagation models, separating
topography specification from numerical implementation. This allows imaging
algorithms to leverage sophisticated topography handling routines without added
complexity.

Immersed boundaries represent free surfaces as sharp interfaces on a regular
grid, accurately reflecting the true surface position. This method eliminates
the need for mesh generation or curvilinear grids, by constructing suitable
field extensions beyond the boundary, which are incorporated into
surface-adjacent FD operators, enforcing the necessary boundary conditions.

Our paper, [A Novel Immersed Boundary Approach for Irregular Topography with
Acoustic Wave Equations](https://doi.org/10.1190/geo2023-0515.1), published
earlier this year in *Geophysics*, demonstrates this approach by modeling wave
propagation around the complex topography of Mount St. Helens.

As illustrated below, the 3D free-surface wavefield is accurately rendered,
capturing the intricate interactions of the wavefield with steep, uneven
terrain. This showcases the power of the immersed boundary method in addressing
real-world seismic challenges.

## Applying to Land Seismic Data

We are collaborating with service companies like
[S-Cube](https://www.s-cube.com/) to apply these methods to
real-world land seismic applications. Accurately modeling acoustic and elastic
TTI wavefield behavior in environments with pronounced and irregular topography
is essential. Our immersed boundary method effectively captures topographic
effects such as surface multiples, amplitude variations, and diffraction around
obstacles while maintaining the regular computational grids commonly used in
imaging applications. This makes it an ideal choice for integrating topography
handling into existing solvers and imaging workflows.

The innovation here lies in the robustness and generality of the approach,
allowing integration into existing seismic data processing pipelines. The
boundary treatment is tied to the discretization, boundary conditions, and
geometry but not to the governing equations. Through symbolic computation and a
generalized mathematical approach, immersed boundary treatments can be generated
for various equations and boundary conditions, ensuring flexibility and ease of
use. For example, higher-order free surface conditions derived from isotropic
acoustic wave equations behave similarly in acoustic TTI contexts, offering a
computationally efficient alternative.
