subtitle: Devito Codes announces new collaboration with AMD
description: Devito is a popular open-source DSL for coding performance portable code
  in Python using symbolic computation for evolving. While previously Devito only
  supported AMD GPUs using OpenMP offloading, thanks to a recent collaboration with
  AMD, DevitoPRO now also generates optimized HIP directly.

[Devito](https://www.devitoproject.org) is a domain-specific Language (DSL) and
code generation framework for the design of highly optimized finite-difference
kernels for use in simulation, inversion, and optimization. Devito utilizes a
combination of symbolic computation and compiler technologies to automatically
generate highly optimized software for a wide range of computer architectures.

Previously Devito only supported AMD GPUs using OpenMP offloading. Thanks to
Devito Codes' new collaboration with AMD, we quickly extended the Devito compiler
support HIP for AMD GPUs. This resulted in a substantial uplift in
performance, achieving competitive levels of performance with comparable
architectures. 

This is exciting news for our users who use Devito in high-performance computing
and data-intensive applications, including seismic imaging (Fig 1) and medical
imaging (Fig 2).

Devito is easy to use and reduces the development time of high-performance code from months to days. While performance is invariably critical once the software goes into production, the overwhelming feedback from the academic and industrial user communities is that reducing cycle time has the greatest material impact on business.
