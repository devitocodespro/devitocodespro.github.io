subtitle: Now with Instinct™
description: Core to the Devito mission is performance portability. Of course, if
  it is not tested then it is assumed to be broken. We maintain a dedicated cluster
  for all our DevOps needs.

### TLDR
Thanks to support from AMD we are happy to announce:

* DevitoPRO now has HIP support for AMD Instinct™ GPU's
* [AMAX AceleMax DGS-428 4U Server](https://www.amax.com/ai-optimized-solutions/acelemax-dgs-428as/) has been added to the Devito DevOps cluster.

### Nitty Gritty

One of Devito's core missions is performance portability. Our current roadmap
targets the matrix of architectures and parallel programming models below.

| Architecture  | CUDA     | HIP                                  | MPI        | OpenACC    | OpenMP     |
|---------------|----------|--------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|
| AMD/CPU       |          |                                      | <i class="fas fa-check text-xl"></i> |            | <i class="fas fa-check text-xl"></i> |
| AMD/GPU       |          | <i class="fas fa-check text-xl"></i> | <i class="fas fa-check text-xl"></i> | | <i class="fas fa-check text-xl"></i> |
| ARM           |          |                                      | <i class="fas fa-check text-xl"></i> | | <i class="fas fa-check text-xl"></i> |

| Intel/KNC,KNL |          |                                      | <i class="fas fa-check text-xl"></i> | | <i class="fas fa-check text-xl"></i> |

To support the delivery of this vision, since January 2020 Devito Codes has
maintained a distributed cluster as part of our DevOps infrastructure for both
open-source Devito and DevitoPRO. This provides services such as:

* Testing (i.e. CI) [^1].
* Performance optimization on 'bare metal' target platforms.
* Performance benchmarking [^2].
* Deployment (i.e. CD via Docker and release mirrors).

While Devito Codes invested directly in hardware at the outset, long term loans
and donations now make up the majority of the cluster [^3]. At the time of
writing the cluster is comprised of:

| Model            | units | CPU               | GPU                  | Sponsor                            |

While we were optimizing for the Intel KNC and KNL, [DUG]{https://dug.com/}
provided us with access to nodes for DevOps. Today they are running their own
DevOps on KNC and KNL for [DUG
Wave](https://dug.com/geoscience-services/full-waveform-inversion-fwi/) which
depends upon Devito. So far no problems have been experienced so long as we
monitor for performance regression on Intel Xeon's running with OpenMP.

We do all our deployment on the cluster using Docker containers. We do this to
ensure that the same environment is used for testing and deployment. This has
also been useful for performance debugging on Cloud platforms, such as AWS and
Azure, because we can differentiated between Docker related issues and the
underlying platform.

Early on we relied on Cloud computing nodes rather than our own hardware. However, we ran into a number of issues:

* Sponsored Cloud credit severely limited what architectures we were able to test on - in particular we would not use any modern GPU.
* It was difficult to control costs. We make heavy use of _GitHub Actions_ for automation. Self hosted runners require you to run a client on your _self-hosted runner_. This _always on_ model meant we would rack up an eye-watering bill at the end of each month - in fact, this is what provided the initial motivation to build our own cluster.

There is no doubt that we will revisit the Cloud in the future with a smarter
strategy to control costs. However, we are committed to continuing with our
strategy of maintaining our own hardware so we can always drill down to bare
metal when we are looking for maximum performance.

[^1]: If it is not tested, then it is broken. 

[^2]: Performance benchmark specification includes code verification for correctness.

[^3]: Many thanks to all the vendors that helped make the Devito Cluster happen: AMD, Dell, DUG, NVidia, Supermicro
