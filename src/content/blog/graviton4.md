With the general availability of [AWS
Graviton4](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/graviton4-aws-cloud-computing-chip),
we explore its performance advancements over previous Graviton generations using
DevitoPRO's standard 3D acoustic wave propagation kernels. These Full Waveform
Inversion (FWI) and Reverse Time Migration (RTM) propagation kernels, serve as
benchmarks to develop cost models and assess computational efficiency.

The [AWS Graviton4](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/r8g/) exhibits substantial performance improvements compared to its
predecessors. For **3D Isotropic acoustic**, the AWS Graviton4 (r8g.24xlarge)
delivers performance that is approximately 2.7 times faster than Graviton2 and
81% faster than Graviton3. In the [3D Fletcher Du Fowler
TTI](https://doi.org/10.1190/1.3269902) benchmark, the Graviton4 outperforms
Graviton2 by over 3.4 times and is 51% faster than Graviton3. Similarly, the [3D
Self-adjoint TTI](https://library.seg.org/doi/10.1190/segam2016-13878451.1)
benchmark on AWS Graviton4 runs nearly 3.6 times faster than Graviton2 and 80%
faster than Graviton3.

These results underscore the significant generational improvements in the
Graviton4, particularly for memory-bound high-performance computing
applications.

### Graviton4 - Amazon EC2 R8g Instances

The Amazon EC2 instance type *r8g.24xlarge* is a single socket Graviton4. The
Graviton4 processors offer significant advancements over the Graviton3. The
Graviton4 has 96 Neoverse V2 cores and a revamped memory subsystem, featuring
[12 DDR5-5600 channels and a peak memory bandwidth of 536.7 GB/s, which is 75%
higher than the
Graviton3.](https://www.nextplatform.com/2023/11/28/aws-adopts-arm-v2-cores-for-expansive-graviton4-server-cpu/)
These improvements are particularly beneficial for memory-bound HPC
applications, such as finite-difference based FWI/RTM operators​.

### Compiling on Graviton using GCC-14.1

To optimize the performance of our benchmarks on the AWS Graviton4 processor, we
built [GCC 14.1](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-14/) from source, rather than the
system default for Amazon Linux 2023 (6.1.94-99.176.amzn2023.aarch64) which is
GCC 11.4.1. GCC 14.1 has a range of improvements that enhance the compiler's
ability to leverage the advanced features of the Neoverse cores, particularly
the Neoverse V2 architecture used in Graviton4.

Key enhancements in GCC 14 include improved support for vectorization and new
optimizations that are tailored for Neoverse V2 cores. These improvements allow
for better exploitation of the high memory bandwidth and increased core count in
Graviton4, resulting in more efficient execution of high-performance computing
workloads. Additionally, the release includes enhancements in
auto-vectorization, which are particularly beneficial for memory-bound
applications like seismic imaging and simulation tasks.

Devito uses the following GCC flags depending on the generation of Graviton to
maximize performance on a given instance. As there is just one NUMA domain in
all cases, we parallelizing with pure OpenMP.

Graviton2 (Neoverse-N1):
```sh
gcc-14 -mcpu=neoverse-n1 -O3 -g -fPIC -Wall -std=c99 -Wno-unused-result -Wno-unused-variable -Wno-unused-but-set-variable -ffast-math -shared -fopenmp
```

Graviton3 (Neoverse-V1):
```sh
gcc-14 -mcpu=neoverse-v1 -O3 -g -fPIC -Wall -std=c99 -Wno-unused-result -Wno-unused-variable -Wno-unused-but-set-variable -ffast-math -shared -fopenmp
```

Graviton4 (Neoverse-V2):
```sh
gcc-14 -mcpu=neoverse-v2 -O3 -g -fPIC -Wall -std=c99 -Wno-unused-result -Wno-unused-variable -Wno-unused-but-set-variable -ffast-math -shared -fopenmp
```

### 3D acoustic benchmarks

To evaluate the performance of the Graviton4, we conducted benchmarks using
three standard 3D acoustic wave propagation kernels. These tests were run in
single precision with OpenMP thread parallelism. Each benchmark was carefully
autotuned to optimize parameters such as cache block size, and the best result
from multiple runs was recorded.

These benchmarks are categorized based on their operational intensity. The
isotropic acoustic benchmark is the simplest among them, commonly used in
seismic imaging, and its performance is primarily influenced by memory
bandwidth. The Fletcher-Du-Fowler TTI kernel, which is frequently utilized by
hardware vendors for benchmarking, represents a moderate level of complexity. In
contrast, the self-adjoint TTI kernel, designed for robustness and accuracy, is
employed in production workloads, reflecting the most demanding computational
requirements for acoustic FWI/RTM. This categorization allows for a
comprehensive evaluation of performance across a spectrum of real-world
scenarios.

All three benchmarks were run with a fixed problem size of dimensions
512x512x512, for a total of 400 time-steps, space-order 8 and time-order 2.

In the bar-chart below we show how the Graviton3 and Graviton4 performance
relative to the Graviton2. The *r6g.16xlarge*, *r7g.16xlarge*,*r8g.16xlarge* all
have 64 cores; this highlights the performance improvement per core. In
contrast, the *r8g.24xlarge* (a single socket Graviton4) has a total of 96
cores. We can see some strong scaling limits running the isotropic acoustic
benchmark as we go from *r8g.16xlarge* the *r8g.24xlarge* (~10% performance
improvement). However, this does not appear to be an issue when running with
more complex propagator kernels such as TTI.

### Price performance

The overall picture for price-performance also looks good for AWS users, though
there are some nuances. In the bar-chart below we use the AWS on-demand pricing
for each instance and the benchmark performance in units of
*giga-points-per-second* to create a *tera-points-per-dollar* (TP/$) benchmark
metric. This is a measure of how much work you get done per dollar allowing
users to get an estimate of the *price-to-solution*.

For the isotropic acoustic and the self-adjoint acoustic TTI, we can see that
the Graviton4 delivers the highest throughput per dollar, followed by Graviton3
and Graviton2.

However, the Fletcher Du Fowler TTI benchmark presents an exception. In this
case, Graviton3 provides the highest throughput per dollar, followed by
Graviton4 and then Graviton2. Although both the isotropic acoustic and
self-adjoint TTI benchmarks are 81% faster on Graviton4 than on Graviton3, the
Fletcher Du Fowler TTI benchmark is only 51% faster on Graviton4 than on
Graviton3. Given that the theoretical increase in memory bandwidth is 75%, this
discrepancy warrants a deeper performance profiling analysis to understand why
this particular benchmark underperforms relative to the other benchmarks.

### Graviton4 r8g.16xlarge vs r8g.24xlarge

When choosing between the *r8g.16xlarge* and *r8g.24xlarge* instances, it is
important to consider the specific characteristics of your workload. For
workloads where the problem domain is too small to benefit from strong scaling
across all available cores, allocating the entire node and running multiple
shots per node can provide better value. This approach not only maximizes
resource utilization but also helps avoid the potential impact of noisy
neighbors in multi-tenant environments if *r8g.16xlarge* was instead used.

By fully utilizing the *r8g.24xlarge* instance, which contains all 96 cores of the
Graviton4 processor, you can achieve more consistent performance, as the risk of
resource contention from other tenants is minimized. This strategy ensures you
get the best possible value from the Graviton4 architecture for your HPC tasks.

### Conclusion

AWS Graviton4 processor. With its increased core count and higher memory
bandwidth, the Graviton4 significantly enhances the performance of
high-performance computing (HPC) applications. Our benchmarks show that
DevitoPRO, utilizing AWS Graviton4, achieves substantial performance gains over
previous Graviton generations, particularly for memory-bound applications such
as seismic imaging.
